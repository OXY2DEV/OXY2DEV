Hey there!ðŸ‘‹

My name is `OXY2DEV`(no, that's not my real name). I am a student who likes programming & *terminals*.

Originally, I wanted to try learning `Web Dev`. But nowadays, I spend most of my free time making plugins for `Neovim`.

I also do everything on my `phone`(via `Termux`) due to not having a PC(no need to feel bad for me).
